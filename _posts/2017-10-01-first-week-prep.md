We will be having our first meeting on Tuesday, the third of October. After an introduction, we'll be starting off by **installing Linux** on the workstations. As a reminder, we meet in **room 15**. Room 15 is a computer lab, with a door to another computer lab, dubbed the "networking lab." That is where we will be.  <a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=Y29wM2VvajE2Z3BqOGI5aTY4cTY4YjlrY2tvM2liYjFjOWo2Y2I5aWNrcWphZGhpNzVpbTZvaG9jNCB0d2xpbnV4ODZAbQ&amp;tmsrc=twlinux86%40gmail.com"><img border="0" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button1_en.gif"></a>

If you would like to bring your own laptop, feel free, though *this is optional.* 

If you have a spare USB flash drive, please bring it. 

We will be working initially with a distro called [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), which is based on [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/). Ubuntu is the most popular distribution for beginners (though I'm not particularly fond of it).

Download the Elementary OS ISO from their website (<https://elementary.io/>) and image your USB flash drive according to [this guide I wrote](https://github.com/jennydaman/twlinux/wiki/Creating-a-bootable-Linux-live-disk-with-Rufus-on-Microsoft-Windows).

*Pantheon, the desktop environment of Elementary, is usually described as a MacOS clone.* 

If you have any difficulties with this procedure, or don't have a USB flash drive to spare, just send me (Jennings) a quick message.
