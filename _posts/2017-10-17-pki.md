OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) defines a standard of how asymmetric cryptographical algorithms can be used to encrypt and sign files.

[GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) (GNU Privacy Gaurd) is the msot common tool used on Linux for PGP.

## Basic concepts

1. A private-public key pair is generated.
2. You distribute your public key.
3. Others use your public key to encrypt information before sending it to you.
4. You decrypt their message using your private key.

A message encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. A message encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the corresponding public key. (Without [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing),) The universe would collapse from [heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) before any computer could crack 2048-bit RSA encryption using brute force. 

{: .box-warning}
The private key must be kept a secret. Anyone possessing your private key can impersonate you.

Asymmetric cryptography guarantees **non-repudiation** and **confidentiality**.

# GnuPG (GPG) 

Install the [gnupg](https://packages.ubuntu.com/artful/gnupg) package.

Generate a key pair:

```sh
gpg --full-gen-key
```

For the commands below:

- `public.key` refers to a public key (ASCII).
- `user-id` identifies a key. It can be the key ID< fingerprint, or a person's name or email address.
- `doc` represents an unencrypted file.
- `doc.gpg` represents an encrypted file.

### Export your public key

```sh
gpg --output public.key --armor --export user-id
```

### Decryption

```sh
gpg --output doc --decrypt doc.gpg
```


### Importing a public key

```sh
gpg --import public.key
```

### Encryption

```
gpg --recipient user-id --encrypt doc
```
