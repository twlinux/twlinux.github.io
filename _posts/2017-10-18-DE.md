# Desktop environment

The graphical user interface of *NIX operating systems are managed by an "X server".

[GNOME 3](https://www.gnome.org/) is the most popular desktop environment on Linux.

{: .box-error}
The computers in our lab were replaced with **Ubuntu 17.10**, some running Ubuntu's GNOME, and others on Budgie (which is more lightweight).

The official release date of [Ubuntu 17.10](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/ReleaseNotes) is October 19, 2017. The beta is *unstable.* Ubuntu 17.10 features a modified version of GNOME 3. GNOME is not a lightweight desktop environment, and might suffer from performance issues on the hardware we use.

#### GNOME extensions

<https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation>

GNOME extensions can be downloaded and managed from <https://extensions.gnome.org/>, or through [GNOME Tweaks](https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/gnome-tweak-tool) (`gnome-tweak-tool`). 

# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

- `/` is the root of the filesystem, which holds all your system files.
- `/home` is where your user's directory is located. You have write access to your home folder only. Your home folder is denoted as `~` (tilde) by most shells, and it contains your documents, pictures, configurations, and other ordinary files.
- `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`, which contains executable binaries.
- `/boot` contains static files for the bootloader.
- `/dev` holds "block devices". Physical and logical devices can be interacted with through their block devices in `/dev`.
    - `/dev/sda` represents the first physical drive.
    - `/dev/sda1` is the first partition on that drive.
    - `/dev/null` is a pseudo-device that behaves much like `null` in any context of computer science. It discards any data written to it. 
- `/etc/` contains configuration files.
- `/lib` holds shared libraries.
- `/proc` provides information about running processes and the kernel.
- `/usr` is a seconday heirarchy containing mostly read-only data. 

See `man hier` or <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard> for details.
