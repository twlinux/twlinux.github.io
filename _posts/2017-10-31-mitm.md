## Address Resolution Protocol

The address resolution protocol (ARP) resolves a IPv4 address to the corresponding MAC address.

## telnet

We will demonstrate ARP poisoning attacks against the **telnet** protocol. Telnet is a method of remotely accessing a server.

Telnet is legacy software, it transmits sensitive content in plaintext. We're using it for demonstrational purposes. **Never** use telnet in practice.

# ARP Poisoning

> The aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, [...] causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.
