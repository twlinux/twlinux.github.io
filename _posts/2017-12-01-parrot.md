In our networking lab, computers in the far row that were running Vanilla Ubuntu 17.10 were replaced with Parrot Security OS. The other row still has Ubuntu Budgie. ParrotSec is less popular than Kali, though this is advantageous: MCPS has not blocked it (yet).

- ParrotSec is based on Debian. <light>(So is Kali and Ubuntu)</light>
- ParrotSec features the [MATE desktop environment](https://mate-desktop.org/). (Kali and Ubuntu use GNOME 3.26. MATE is more lightweight compared to GNOME.)
- ParrotSec, like Kali, is used for advanced penetration testing.
