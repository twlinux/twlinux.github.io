This event will take place on *December 19th, 2017* and also *January 2nd, 2018* at 14:40.

I developed the full-stack of a static web blog. Use your knowledge and creativity to crack the server! And it sucks. Your objective is simple: tamper the website.

You will work in teams of two or three. Only two restrictions: no physical access, and don't DOS anyone.

Using the Internet to do research during your attack is encouraged (and is likely necessary).

The server is developed with node.js, and the webpages are coded in HTML. Prior knowledge in ECMA JavaScript and HTML is not important, however you should at least be comfortable with looking at and understanding computer code.
