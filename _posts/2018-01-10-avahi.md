The name of Linux Club was changed to **Red Team.** <https://twlinux.github.io/about>

We will have bi-weekly challenges. These can be puzzles related to system administration or security CTFs (capture the flag). testing both your understanding of Linux and penetration testing.

No more arbitrary IPv4 addresses! mDNS advertising is accomplished using Avahi.

On our LAN, the servers can be reached at human-readable domain names that follow the scheme `<codename>.local`. For example: <http://unsafe.local/>.
