This is another lab which does not have much to do with any specific topic of security. Rather, it tests your understanding of Linux and problem-solving ability. In preparation, we should review some basic concepts.

1. What is a [hash function](/2018-03-04-hash)? What is a *cryptographic* hash function?
3. What are some common uses of a cryptographic hash function?
3. What is a (UTF-8) "plaintext" file vs. a "binary" file?
4. How do you apply the [*kill chain*](https://twlinux.github.io/2017-10-30-kali/) methodology to a penetration test?

Be familiar with relevant Linux commands, like `ping`, `nmap`, and `grep`.

The content above contains some dead giveaways on how to solve this week's challenge. But of course, not everything has been spoiled. What to do when you get stuck? Remember...

> Google is your friend!

Your team will be assigned a server, either `potato0.local`, `potato1.local`, or `potato2.local`. These servers (should be) identical. You can SSH into the servers on the default port 22, with the credentials below:

```
Username: potato
Password: starch
```
