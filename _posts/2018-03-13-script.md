Shell usage is the most important skill of a Linux user, which is why we first introduced the concept during [week 2](/2017-10-10-cli/). So far, we used bash *interactively*, by typing commands one after another. Often, it makes sense to execute a chain of commands automatically. Remember how repetitive it was to conduct `arpspoof` attacks? Actions can be automated with [*scripts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language). A basic introduction to bash syntax is available on our [wiki](https://github.com/twlinux/club/wiki/Shell-scripting). Below is an example of a pointless script. It does not take full advantage of bash's many features, so that the syntax would be easier to understand.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" = *"-h"* ]]; then
  cat << EOF
usage: ./example.sh [OPTION]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  --create-folder   make a folder
EOF
  exit 0

elif [ "$1" = "--create-folder" ]; then
  
  folder_name=tux_the_penguin
  mkdir $folder_name
  echo "Made a folder, it's name is \"$folder_name\""

  printf "Should I remove that folder now? [y/N] " # no new line
  read response
  if [ "$response" = "y" ] || [ "$response" = "Y" ] || [ "${response,,}" = "yes" ]; then
    rmdir $folder_name
    echo "I removed the folder."
  fi
fi

echo "Goodbye"
{% endhighlight %}

## Steganography (potato followup)

You can review the solution here. <https://github.com/twlinux/potato/wiki>

It's your turn! Write a bash script which appends plaintext to image files. Below is sample output.

```bash
$ ./hide.sh image.jpg
Enter secret text: chicken nugger and french fried

$ ./hide.sh --reveal image.jpg
The secret is: chicken nugger and french fried
```

Feel free to add more features, the most impressive script will win the sticker below.
