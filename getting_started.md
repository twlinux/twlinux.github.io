# The Kernel

Linux is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) kernel. It is often shipped with [GNU software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities) as a complete operating system.

# Installing Linux

Microsoft provides the [Linux subsystem for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), which runs a native Linux environment on top of Windows 10. Even [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-in-the-windows-app-store/) is available from the Windows App Store, however setup isn't exactly straightforward. They have a cool video guide for running the XFCE4 desktop environment on top of Windows 10 too...

The most common recommendation is to play around with [Linux distros](2017-10-03-week-one) on Oracle VM VirtualBox.

Do you have an Android device? Because Android is powered by Linux! However, use of a command line on touchscreens is clumsy. (though if you're interested, <https://termux.com/>).

For the daring, install Linux directly to your disk. You can replace your previous operating system, or partition a dual boot configuration. Don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:twlinux86@gmail.com) for more help.
